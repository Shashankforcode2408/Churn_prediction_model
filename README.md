# Churn_prediction_model
Churn prediction involves identifying customers who might cancel a service based on their usage patterns. This prediction holds significant importance for businesses as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Detecting at-risk customers enables tailored marketing strategies, allowing businesses to take specific actions for each customer, ultimately increasing the likelihood of customer retention.

# Steps involved in Model Deployment:
1. Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing.
3. Feature Engineering.
4. Feature Selection (SelectKBest)
5. Fit into Algorithm (ML Algorithm)

# Objective of the model
1. To determine the percentage of customers who churn and those who remain active
2. To analyze the data to identify features influencing customer churn, and
3. To identify the most suitable machine learning model for accurately classifying churn and non-churn customers.
